_________________________

Added descriptions to the decisions.

_________________________

Added images for Strategic Resource Factory deposits.

Replaced the existing Edicts and Decisions with Custom UI, making the factory far easier to control.

Added Queue functionality, so you can queue up several constructions.

Added Fallback functionality, so you can choose whether the Automation and Queue will only buid on the correct planets, or simply prefer them.

Rolled the Document Factory Edict into the new custom UI for controlling the Factory.

Changed the Advisor over to a custom UI, allowing far simpler navigation of topics. The content of the advisor has also been overhauled, due to how you manage the factory being overhauled.

All factory functions can now be controlled from the single Country UI, accessed by the Factory Terminal edict. It can also be accessed from planet specific Factory Terminals.

The factory terminals show how many factory deposits are in the empire/on the planet, and include how many are queued to build, and how many are currently being built.

Added a check for vanilla swapping, so it doesn't convert buildings if there are no district slots left.

Converted separate deposits for Habitats into triggered modifiers on the normal deposits.

Factory module costs now follow the district costs of the planet they are being built on. No longer will Ecu factories cost just as much as a factory on a normal planet.

Retooling has been redone so it works with the new queue system.

Added more triggered modifiers to cancel out OP technician modifiers that are inherited.

Added a button to open the Country Factory Terminal in the bottom left of the screen.

Included triggers to prepare for allowing anyone to use the factory, leaving the origin to have a head start on it.

The Planet UI includes an option to block the primary Autofab being built by Automation or the Queue on that planet.

The Country UI has an option to block the primary Autofab from being built by Automation or the Queue.

Included support for ringworld districts. The Factory is allowed to have Generator Modules on Ringworlds, regardless of who owns it.

Added an AP to allow those without the Origin to use the factory.

The Vanilla Forge and Factory buildings now also apply their production increases to the Autofab Forge and Factory Modules, as they would to the Industrial District.

The vanilla Processing Buildings (Energy Grid, Mineral Purification, Food Processing) grant extra production to Factory Modules, as they would to normal districts.

Changed Factory and Forge Modules to normal district cost, instead of building cost.

The Factory is now afffected by the vanilla Subsidy Edicts.

We have a new Workshop Image, and new Origin Icon, and a New Origin Image.

Replaced raw effect dump on menu buttons with a layman's tooltip.*

Fixed Vanilla Swapping to work with 3.0 stuff. It also costs alloys now, as building them directly would.
